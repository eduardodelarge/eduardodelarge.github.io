> Hello my dear friend. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. I am one of the three demons that were assigned to you at your birth. You know, some people in this world are destined for greatness, destined to live happily ever after. Now you...
You're not one of those people, and it's our job to make sure of that.
Who we are? Oh yes of course, how rude of me. I will tell you...
Shame is my little brother, the demon on his left shoulder. Shame says you're a freak, that you'll never fit in.
Shame is what makes you hate yourself.
Fear sits on your right shoulder. He's my big brother, as old as life itself. Fear fills every dark corner with monsters, turns every stranger on a dark street into a murderer. Fear prevents you from telling your crush how you feel.
He tells you it's best not to try. Fear makes you build your own prison.
Who am I? I am the worst of your demons, but you will always see me as a friend. You turn to me when you have nothing left, because I live in your heart. I'm the only one who forces you to keep putting up with all this. I am the one who prolongs your torment.
Regards,
Hope.
