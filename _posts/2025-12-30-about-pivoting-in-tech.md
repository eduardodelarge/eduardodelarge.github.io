After 3 years since i pivoted to tech and worked as field service (the "it guy") and as NOC (Network Operations Center), i've found my next step of interest to be SOC(Security Analyst Operation). Working in security tends to be kinda scary since the consequences of doing something wrong can lead to massive leaks and all kinds of problems, but the challange of protecting something from some bad actors is exciting as much. But what exacly a SOC does?
